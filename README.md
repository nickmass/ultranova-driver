# ultranova driver

Linux drivers for the Novation Ultranova Synthesizer, runs in userspace and presents the synth as a JACK midi device. Based on the [ultranova4linux](https://github.com/hansfbaier/ultranova4linux) project, but written in Rust and some ergonomic changes that fit my workflow better.
